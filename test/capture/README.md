The file `build.bat` was generated by ThinApp 5.2.3-6945559.

It was modified to remove a reference to the local install.

I experimented with capturing both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of `cmd.exe`.
However, this isn't a very portable approach. I'd assume that on a 32-bit OS,
`C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` would be 32-bit!

Surprisingly, both `cmd32.exe` and `cmd64.exe` produced by ThinApp were 32-bit applications, according to their PE header. No idea why.

```ini
[cmd32.dat]
Source=%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\cmd.exe
ReadOnlyData=Package.ro.tvr
MetaDataContainerOnly=1
WorkingDirectory=#25drive_X#25

[cmd32.exe]
Source=%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\cmd.exe
Shortcut=cmd32.dat
WorkingDirectory=#25drive_X#25

[cmd64.dat]
Source=%SystemSystem%\cmd.exe
ReadOnlyData=Package.ro.tvr
MetaDataContainerOnly=1
WorkingDirectory=#25drive_X#25

[cmd64.exe]
Source=%SystemSystem%\cmd.exe
Shortcut=cmd64.dat
WorkingDirectory=#25drive_X#25
```
